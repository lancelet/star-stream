Abstract:
The paper "Gaia Data Release 2: The photometric content and validation‚Äù by 
Evans et al. (more info on https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/dr2-papers) 
describes the photometric content of the second data release of the Gaia project 
(Gaia DR2) and its validation along with the quality of the data. 
The validation is mainly carried out using an internal analysis of the
photometry. External comparisons are also made, but are limited by the
precision and systematics that may be present in the external catalogues used.
In addition to the photometric quality assessment, we present the best 
estimates of the three photometric passbands. Various colour-colour 
transformations are also derived enabling the users to convert between the 
Gaia and commonly-used passbands. The internal analysis of the data shows that 
the photometric calibrations can reach a precision as low as 2 mmag. Other 
tests show that systematic effects are present in the data at the 10 mmag level.

Description:
These tabular data describes the photometric system defined by the G, G_BP 
and G_RP Gaia bands for Data Release 2.
The tables provide the full passband and the corresponding zero point
for each of the photometric bands. The zero points are available both in
the VEGAMAG and AB systems.
The passband calibration is based on the modelling of a set of corrections 
applied to pre-launch knowledge of the instrument, to find the best match 
between observed and synthetic photometry for a set of calibrators. This is 
limited by the set of calibrators available, for which very high accuracy SEDs 
have been obtained as part of this project. This implies that the resulting 
passbands are not fully constrained and other solutions are possible that might
be better at reproducing photometry of sources whose SEDs are not well 
represented by the adopted set of calibrators.
Two reconstructions of the Gaia DR2 photometric system are given: the one
used for the generation of the released magnitudes and of the astrophysical
parameters, and a revised one using the most updated nominal passbands.
